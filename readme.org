* lem.el

=lem.el= is an Emacs client library and interface for Lemmy, the federated link-aggregator. For information about Lemmy, see [[http://joinlemmy.org][joinlemmy.org]].

=lem-api.el= is the API requests layer. All functions make requests and return JSON data pased into Elisp.

The idea is that it's then possible to write different frontends so users can read lemmy posts in whatever forms they like. Possibilities are notmuch, gnus, md4rd, elfeed, or a standalone rendering option more like =mastodon.el=.

Currently, most of the basic endpoints are implemented, and most but not all parameters for each endpoint. There is an active todo list of endpoints in =lem-api.el=.

New endpoints are trivial to add with the =lem-define-request= macro.

=lem-ui.el= is our own basic interface layer. It's new and a bit necro, but coming along fast. It takes some inspiration and code from =mastodon.el=, as that's what I know, and a lot of work has gone into it.

* logging in

Currently, you first need to set =lem-instance-url= to your lemmy instance.

Then the first time you call =lem= you'll be asked for your username and password. Upon logging in, your authentication details will be saved in a plstore under your emacs directory. You "shouldn't" have to provide your password again. If you don't want to have to provide your username, add =(setq lem-current-user "yourusername")= to your init file.

* NB: API instability

The Lemmy developers have clearly stated that the current API version, v3, is unstable and will likely be subject to breaking changes. This will mean =lem.el= will have to play catch-up as things change.

* dependencies

=lem.el= depends on [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/fedi.el][fedi.el]], a library to make writing a library of API requests easier. It also depends on [[https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode][markdown-mode]], and on =hierarchy.el=, which should be included in your emacs.

* contributions

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue to explain if you're working on something, and if you want to work on =lem-ui.el= make sure that what you're doing can't just be pulled in from =mastodon.el= to save work.

Also feel free to get in touch if you want to use =lem-api.el= to build another frontend.
