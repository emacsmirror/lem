* lem

=lem= is an Emacs client library and interface for Lemmy, the federated link-aggregator. For information about Lemmy, see [[http://joinlemmy.org][joinlemmy.org]].

=lem-api.el= is the API requests layer. All functions make requests and return JSON data pased into Elisp.

The idea is that it's then possible to write different frontends so users can read lemmy posts in whatever forms they like. Possibilities are notmuch, gnus, md4rd, elfeed, or a standalone rendering option more like =mastodon.el=.

Currently, most of the basic endpoints are implemented, and most but not all parameters for each endpoint. There is an active todo list of endpoints in the file.

New endpoints are trivial to add with the =lem-request= macro.

=lem-ui.el= is our own basic interface layer. It's new and necro, but coming along. Takes some inspiration from =mastodon.el=, as that's what I know.

* Logging in

See =lem-login= and =lem-login-set-token=. Lemmy seems to just require an =auth= parameter with a token you receive as a response to logging in. Currently this token is saved to the persistent variable =lem-auth-token=, which is probably not smart, but it's easy.

* dependency

=lem= depends on [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/fedi.el][fedi.el]], a library to make writing a library of API requests easier.
